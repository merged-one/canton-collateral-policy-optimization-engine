# Worklog

This log is append-oriented. Every task should record intent before changes and outcomes after changes.

## 2026-03-28 - Prompt 1 - Pre-Change

Intent:
Create the repository's mission-control and documentation spine without adding business logic.

Starting state:

- repository contains only `.git`
- no operating instructions or architecture documents exist yet

Planned commands:

```sh
make status
make docs-lint
make verify
git status --short --branch
```

Expected artifacts:

- repository operating instructions
- mission-control tracker, roadmap, worklog, and decision log
- starter ADR, invariants, risks, evidence, security, testing, and change-control documents

## 2026-03-28 - Prompt 1 - Post-Change

Outcome:
Created the repository's initial mission-control spine and kept the repo documentation-only.

Completed artifacts:

- root operating documents: `README.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `SECURITY.md`, `CODEOWNERS`, `.gitignore`, `Makefile`
- mission-control documents under `docs/mission-control/`
- starter ADR, invariants, risks, evidence, integration, domain, testing, security, runbook, and change-control documents
- prompt execution report in `docs/evidence/prompt-01-execution-report.md`

Commands run:

```sh
make docs-lint
make status
make verify
git status --short --branch
```

Results:

- `make docs-lint` passed
- `make status` reported Phase 0 and the expected untracked documentation tree before commit
- `make verify` passed and confirmed the repository remains documentation-only

Next step:
Pin the target Quickstart or LocalNet and document the first interface and dependency ADRs before adding business logic.
