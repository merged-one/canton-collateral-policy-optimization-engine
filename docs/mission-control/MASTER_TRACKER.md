# Master Tracker

Last Updated: 2026-03-29
Current Phase: Milestone 5 / Phase 5 - Final Conformance And Demo Package

## Mission

Stand up a documentation-first Canton Collateral Control Plane repository: a neutral Canton collateral control-plane prototype that can safely evolve into reusable policy, optimization, workflow, conformance, and reporting components for margin, repo, securities-lending, treasury, collateral mobility, and close-out workflows.

Repository identity note:
The repository's active user-facing name is "Canton Collateral Control Plane". The former name "Canton Collateral Policy & Optimization Engine" is retained only as a deprecated historical alias for continuity in older records, and `C-COPE` should not be used in new documentation.

## Scope

- define repository governance, change control, and contribution rules
- establish proposal-aligned architecture, invariant, risk, evidence, and testing scaffolding
- prepare for a pinned Quickstart-based LocalNet, token-standard-style asset model, and Daml workflow baseline
- shape the repo around a reusable collateral policy language, optimizer, workflow library, and conformance suite
- provide an auditable control spine for future implementation phases

## Non-Goals

- shipping production-grade business logic in this phase
- claiming validated economics or regulatory compliance
- integrating with live custodians, CCPs, or central-bank platforms
- becoming a venue, CCP, custodian, price-oracle business, or legal-document system
- generating demo outputs without executable backing

## Architectural Pillars

1. Neutral collateral control-plane design reusable across multiple Canton apps.
2. Versioned Collateral Policy Language for eligibility, haircuting, concentration, control, and substitution rights.
3. Deterministic policy evaluation and optimization with explanation traces.
4. Atomic multi-party workflow execution and control semantics on Canton.
5. Conformance, reporting, and auditability as first-class outputs.
6. Documentation, evidence, and test traceability from the start.

## Current Phase

Milestone 5 / Phase 5 now packages the existing policy, optimization, workflow, and reporting layers into one reproducible proposal-ready surface. The expected output is a reproducible conformance suite and final demo pack that consume declared scenario inputs, emit machine-readable evidence, prove positive plus negative paths, expose invariant pass or fail output, and document the third-party integration boundary without pretending the full Quickstart deployment is complete.

Prompt 1 status:

- documentation spine created
- baseline verification commands added
- repository remains intentionally free of business logic pending pinned dependency and interface decisions

Proposal alignment status:

- repository framing updated to the current control-plane model
- roadmap now mirrors the proposal milestone structure
- invariants expanded toward the proposal's conformance-suite acceptance criteria
- future proposal changes should be incorporated through ADRs rather than informal drift

Repository identity status:

- rename clarified that policy, optimization, workflow orchestration, conformance, and reporting are subsystems of one shared collateral control plane
- control-plane responsibilities remain distinct from data-plane assets, ledger state, settlement rails, and LocalNet execution
- subsystem names remain intact; only user-facing identity and safe in-repo metadata were updated

Prompt 2 status:

- architecture boundaries defined for policy, evaluation, optimization, workflow, reporting, and runtime infrastructure
- collateral domain model, actor model, and lifecycle states documented
- Quickstart integration and token-standard alignment assumptions documented for future implementation
- repository remains documentation-only pending pinned dependencies, schema design, and package boundaries

Prompt 3 status:

- `CPL v0.1` prose specification published under `docs/specs/`
- machine-readable JSON Schema published at `schema/cpl.schema.json`
- example central-bank-style, tri-party-style, CCP-style, and bilateral CSA-style policies published and validated
- `make validate-cpl` added as a reproducible repository control command
- repository remains implementation-light: policy engine, optimization engine, workflow packages, and report schemas are still pending

Prompt 4 status:

- Daml runtime foundation pinned to Daml SDK `2.10.4`, Canton `2.10.4`, and Temurin JDK `17.0.18+8`
- repo-local bootstrap, status, build, demo, portable-verify, and full-verify commands published under `Makefile` and `scripts/`
- minimal executable Daml package added under `daml/` to prove compile-and-run readiness without collateral business logic
- future service-layer code now has reserved `app/`, `reports/`, `test/`, `examples/`, and `infra/` surfaces

Prompt 5 status:

- first Daml contract boundary added under `daml/CantonCollateral/` for roles, assets, inventory, encumbrance, obligations, posting, substitution, return, settlement instructions, and execution reporting
- lifecycle skeletons now cover margin call issuance, collateral posting intent, substitution approval and rejection, margin return request, and settlement confirmation or exception paths
- `make daml-test` and `Bootstrap:workflowSmokeTest` now provide executable lifecycle checks against the pinned SDK
- policy evaluation, optimization, report disclosure profiles, and external asset-adapter integrations remain separate future layers

Prompt 6 status:

- first deterministic `CPL v0.1` policy evaluation engine added under `app/policy-engine/`
- engine now evaluates eligibility, haircut, lendable value, concentration, encumbrance, segregation, settlement-currency mismatch, and wrong-way-risk outcomes against normalized candidate inventory
- machine-readable `PolicyEvaluationReport` contract published under `reports/schemas/` with spec, ADR, test plan, and generated example artifact
- `make policy-eval` and `make test-policy-engine` now provide reproducible policy-engine evaluation and test commands
- role-scoped `ExecutionReport` disclosure profiles, live asset adapters, and reference-data contracts remain future layers

Prompt 7 status:

- first deterministic optimizer added under `app/optimizer/` for best-to-post selection, substitution recommendation, concentration-aware allocation, and deterministic explanation traces
- machine-readable `OptimizationReport` contract published under `reports/schemas/` with spec, ADR, economic rationale, test plan, and generated example artifact
- `make optimize` and `make test-optimizer` now provide reproducible optimization and optimizer-test commands
- optimization remains advisory and off-ledger; workflow reservation, consent, and settlement authority remain future Canton-layer work

Prompt 8 status:

- pinned CN Quickstart LocalNet foundation added under `infra/quickstart/` with commit-based upstream pinning, overlay profiles, and operator documentation
- `make localnet-bootstrap` now stages the upstream checkout and writes a repo-owned `.env.local` overlay without modifying tracked upstream files
- `make localnet-smoke` now reuses upstream Docker preflight checks and validates the composed Quickstart stack as the earliest real runnable LocalNet layer
- LocalNet startup, token-standard-style assets, and confidential collateral seed data remain staged follow-on work; the later runtime bridge work now closes the Control Plane DAR build and install path without forking upstream Quickstart

Prompt 9 status:

- first end-to-end margin-call demo added under `app/orchestration/` and `examples/demo-scenarios/margin-call/`
- `make demo-margin-call` now evaluates positive and negative margin-call scenarios, runs the positive Daml workflow path, and emits a machine-readable `ExecutionReport` plus Markdown summary and timeline artifacts
- the demo now covers negative paths for ineligible collateral, insufficient lendable value, and an expired policy window without fabricating workflow success on blocked cases
- the prototype still runs the positive workflow path on the Daml IDE ledger; Quickstart-backed package deployment and role-scoped report disclosure remain staged follow-on work

Prompt 10 status:

- first end-to-end substitution prototype added under `app/orchestration/` and `examples/demo-scenarios/substitution/`
- `make demo-substitution` now starts from existing encumbered collateral, runs substitution-specific positive and negative scenarios, invokes a parameterized Daml substitution workflow path, and emits a machine-readable `SubstitutionReport` plus Markdown summary and timeline artifacts
- the prototype now proves optimizer-scoped replacement, approval-gated release, unauthorized-release blocking, and atomic all-or-nothing substitution handling without fabricating success on blocked cases
- the substitution workflow still runs on the Daml IDE ledger; Quickstart-backed deployment and role-scoped report disclosure remain staged follow-on work

Prompt 11 status:

- first end-to-end return prototype added under `app/orchestration/` and `examples/demo-scenarios/return/`
- `make demo-return` now starts from existing encumbered collateral, runs retained-set optimization to derive the released lots, invokes a parameterized Daml return workflow path, and emits a machine-readable `ReturnReport` plus Markdown summary and timeline artifacts
- the prototype now proves approval-gated release, replay-safe return identifiers, obligation-state mismatch blocking, and settlement-driven encumbrance release without fabricating success on blocked cases
- the return workflow still runs on the Daml IDE ledger; Quickstart-backed deployment, role-scoped report disclosure, and first-class CPL return-right clauses remain staged follow-on work

Prompt 12 status:

- aggregate conformance suite added under `app/orchestration/` and `test/conformance/`
- `make test-conformance` now re-runs the confidential margin-call, substitution, and return demos, emits a machine-readable `ConformanceSuiteReport`, and proves authorization, determinism, haircut correctness, no double-encumbrance, atomic substitution, replay safety, report fidelity, and audit completeness
- `make demo-all` now packages the confidential workflow demos, conformance output, artifact index, and third-party integration guidance into one machine-readable final demo pack plus Markdown summary
- the Python test harness now includes shared deterministic fixture builders, isolated conformance-helper unit tests, and a Docker-free `make verify-portable` path while `make verify` remains the full Quickstart-aware superset
- the final package still runs its end-to-end workflow demos on the Daml IDE ledger even though the Control Plane DAR can now be built and installed into Quickstart; Quickstart-backed workflow execution remains the next runtime task

Prompt 13 status:

- ADR 0016 now chooses a dual-runtime bridge: the repo keeps host-native Daml SDK `2.10.4` plus JDK `17` for the existing IDE-ledger workflow surface while Quickstart-compatible DAR builds run in Docker on Daml SDK `3.4.10` plus Java `21`
- `make localnet-build-dar` now produces a Quickstart-compatible Control Plane DAR plus package-id metadata from the shared Daml source tree without repinning upstream Quickstart
- `make localnet-deploy-dar` now validates the pinned upstream checkout, rebuilds the Quickstart-compatible DAR, and uploads it through the upstream onboarding container into the running app-provider and app-user participants
- the Daml package now compiles on both runtime lines through explicit source compatibility updates, including a keyless `ReturnRequestRegistry` replay guard and template-specific query helpers
- Quickstart-backed workflow execution, confidential collateral seed data, role-scoped report disclosure, and live asset adapters remain staged follow-on work

## Next 5 Tasks

1. Execute the first Quickstart-backed Control Plane workflow scenario on the installed DAR and emit Quickstart-derived machine-readable evidence rather than IDE-ledger-only evidence.
2. Specify role-scoped `ExecutionReport`, `ReturnReport`, and `SubstitutionReport` disclosure profiles beyond the current operator-facing demo aggregates and workflow-party report baseline.
3. Define versioned reference-data contracts for valuation, FX, custodian, issuer, and counterparty facts consumed by policy evaluation.
4. Define the first workflow-coupled optimizer reservation and consent interface, including substitution-scope and return-release carriage, without collapsing Canton authority.
5. Define the first asset-adapter interface that will consume `SettlementInstruction` and `EncumbranceState` contracts without collapsing workflow authority.

## Blockers

- There is no current blocker for continued documentation, policy-engine, optimizer, and report-contract work.
- There is no current blocker preventing Control Plane DAR build or package installation into the pinned Quickstart LocalNet; the remaining gated work is Quickstart-backed workflow execution, seeded collateral scenarios, and adapter integration on top of the installed package.
- Live asset-adapter and workflow-coupled implementation beyond the current off-ledger engines and Daml skeletons should not proceed until the LocalNet package-deployment path and asset interface versions are pinned explicitly.
- Economic calibration beyond the current deterministic proxy objective is intentionally deferred until reference-data contracts and richer report contracts are specified.
- The current roadmap reflects the 2026-03-28 proposal and may need ADR-backed revision if the proposal changes materially.

- support tri-party-style collateral selection, valuation, and substitution workflows
- encode CCP-style concentration and haircut controls conservatively and transparently
- preserve confidentiality while enabling multi-party atomic workflows on Canton
- support reuse across financing apps, derivatives apps, tokenized-asset platforms, stablecoin rails, and custodial workflows
- emit reports that external review tooling can validate without guessing hidden state
