Current Phase: Milestone 3 / Phase 3 - Initial Optimization And Substitution Engine

## Mission

Stand up a documentation-first Canton Collateral Control Plane repository: a neutral Canton collateral control-plane prototype that can safely evolve into reusable policy, optimization, workflow, conformance, and reporting components for margin, repo, securities-lending, treasury, collateral mobility, and close-out workflows.

Repository identity note:
The repository's active user-facing name is "Canton Collateral Control Plane". The former name "Canton Collateral Policy & Optimization Engine" is retained only as a deprecated historical alias for continuity in older records, and `C-COPE` should not be used in new documentation.

## Scope

- define repository governance, change control, and contribution rules
- establish proposal-aligned architecture, invariant, risk, evidence, and testing scaffolding
- prepare for a pinned Quickstart-based LocalNet, token-standard-style asset model, and Daml workflow baseline
- shape the repo around a reusable collateral policy language, optimizer, workflow library, and conformance suite
- provide an auditable control spine for future implementation phases

## Non-Goals

- shipping production-grade business logic in this phase
- claiming validated economics or regulatory compliance
- integrating with live custodians, CCPs, or central-bank platforms
- becoming a venue, CCP, custodian, price-oracle business, or legal-document system
- generating demo outputs without executable backing

## Architectural Pillars

1. Neutral collateral control-plane design reusable across multiple Canton apps.
2. Versioned Collateral Policy Language for eligibility, haircuting, concentration, control, and substitution rights.
3. Deterministic policy evaluation and optimization with explanation traces.
4. Atomic multi-party workflow execution and control semantics on Canton.
5. Conformance, reporting, and auditability as first-class outputs.
6. Documentation, evidence, and test traceability from the start.

## Current Phase

Milestone 3 / Phase 3 establishes the first executable optimization path for the repository. The expected output is a deterministic off-ledger optimizer that consumes `CPL v0.1`, normalized inventory, and normalized obligation inputs, emits a machine-readable `OptimizationReport`, and stays separate from authoritative workflow state on Canton.

Prompt 1 status:

- documentation spine created
- baseline verification commands added
- repository remains intentionally free of business logic pending pinned dependency and interface decisions

Proposal alignment status:

- repository framing updated to the current control-plane model
- roadmap now mirrors the proposal milestone structure
- invariants expanded toward the proposal's conformance-suite acceptance criteria
- future proposal changes should be incorporated through ADRs rather than informal drift

Repository identity status:

- rename clarified that policy, optimization, workflow orchestration, conformance, and reporting are subsystems of one shared collateral control plane
- control-plane responsibilities remain distinct from data-plane assets, ledger state, settlement rails, and LocalNet execution
- subsystem names remain intact; only user-facing identity and safe in-repo metadata were updated

Prompt 2 status:

- architecture boundaries defined for policy, evaluation, optimization, workflow, reporting, and runtime infrastructure
- collateral domain model, actor model, and lifecycle states documented
- Quickstart integration and token-standard alignment assumptions documented for future implementation
- repository remains documentation-only pending pinned dependencies, schema design, and package boundaries

Prompt 3 status:

- `CPL v0.1` prose specification published under `docs/specs/`
- machine-readable JSON Schema published at `schema/cpl.schema.json`
- example central-bank-style, tri-party-style, CCP-style, and bilateral CSA-style policies published and validated
- `make validate-cpl` added as a reproducible repository control command
- repository remains implementation-light: policy engine, optimization engine, workflow packages, and report schemas are still pending

Prompt 4 status:

- Daml runtime foundation pinned to Daml SDK `2.10.4`, Canton `2.10.4`, and Temurin JDK `17.0.18+8`
- repo-local bootstrap, status, build, demo, and verify commands published under `Makefile` and `scripts/`
- minimal executable Daml package added under `daml/` to prove compile-and-run readiness without collateral business logic
- future service-layer code now has reserved `app/`, `reports/`, `test/`, `examples/`, and `infra/` surfaces

Prompt 5 status:

- first Daml contract boundary added under `daml/CantonCollateral/` for roles, assets, inventory, encumbrance, obligations, posting, substitution, return, settlement instructions, and execution reporting
- lifecycle skeletons now cover margin call issuance, collateral posting intent, substitution approval and rejection, margin return request, and settlement confirmation or exception paths
- `make daml-test` and `Bootstrap:workflowSmokeTest` now provide executable lifecycle checks against the pinned SDK
- policy evaluation, optimization, report disclosure profiles, and external asset-adapter integrations remain separate future layers

Prompt 6 status:

- first deterministic `CPL v0.1` policy evaluation engine added under `app/policy-engine/`
- engine now evaluates eligibility, haircut, lendable value, concentration, encumbrance, segregation, settlement-currency mismatch, and wrong-way-risk outcomes against normalized candidate inventory
- machine-readable `PolicyEvaluationReport` contract published under `reports/schemas/` with spec, ADR, test plan, and generated example artifact
- `make policy-eval` and `make test-policy-engine` now provide reproducible policy-engine evaluation and test commands
- role-scoped `ExecutionReport` disclosure profiles, live asset adapters, and reference-data contracts remain future layers

Prompt 7 status:

- first deterministic optimizer added under `app/optimizer/` for best-to-post selection, substitution recommendation, concentration-aware allocation, and deterministic explanation traces
- machine-readable `OptimizationReport` contract published under `reports/schemas/` with spec, ADR, economic rationale, test plan, and generated example artifact
- `make optimize` and `make test-optimizer` now provide reproducible optimization and optimizer-test commands
- optimization remains advisory and off-ledger; workflow reservation, consent, and settlement authority remain future Canton-layer work

## Next 5 Tasks

1. Define versioned reference-data contracts for valuation, FX, custodian, issuer, and counterparty facts consumed by policy evaluation.
2. Specify role-scoped `ExecutionReport` disclosure profiles beyond the current workflow-party report baseline.
3. Define the first workflow-coupled optimizer reservation and consent interface without collapsing Canton authority.
4. Expand the conformance-suite matrix to cover optimizer determinism, temporal, privacy, replay, substitution, and release scenarios on top of the new engine and Daml package surfaces.
5. Define the first asset-adapter interface that will consume `SettlementInstruction` and `EncumbranceState` contracts without collapsing workflow authority.

## Blockers

- No current blocker for continued optimizer, policy-engine, and report-contract work.
- Live asset-adapter and workflow-coupled implementation beyond the current off-ledger engines and Daml skeletons should not proceed until the target Quickstart overlay and asset interface versions are pinned on top of the current Daml and Canton baseline.
- Economic calibration beyond the current deterministic proxy objective is intentionally deferred until reference-data contracts and richer report contracts are specified.
- The current roadmap reflects the 2026-03-28 proposal and may need ADR-backed revision if the proposal changes materially.

- encode CCP-style concentration and haircut controls conservatively and transparently
- preserve confidentiality while enabling multi-party atomic workflows on Canton
- support reuse across financing apps, derivatives apps, tokenized-asset platforms, stablecoin rails, and custodial workflows
- emit reports that external review tooling can validate without guessing hidden state
- keep third-party integration possible through stable policy, asset, workflow, and reporting interfaces
