# Test Strategy

## Purpose

Testing in this repository exists to prove invariants, not just to increase coverage numbers. Each meaningful feature should map to explicit invariants and reproducible checks.

## Test Layers

1. Document checks
   Verify required control documents, sections, and cross-links exist.
2. Schema and contract tests
   Validate CPL, asset-adapter, and report structures once they exist.
3. Determinism tests
   Check policy evaluation, haircuting, concentration, and optimization reproducibility.
4. Workflow tests
   Check atomicity, authorization, substitution, return, close-out, and replay behavior.
5. Security tests
   Check access control, confidentiality boundaries, and integrity assumptions.
6. Conformance-suite scenarios
   Check negative paths, invariant reports, and scenario-runner outputs against documented expectations.
7. Demo verification
   Check that operator-facing demo flows are backed by real commands and generated artifacts.

## Current Baseline

At this phase, the repository supports documentation checks, schema validation, deterministic policy-engine tests, and executable Daml workflow checks:

```sh
make bootstrap
make localnet-bootstrap
make localnet-smoke
make localnet-start-control-plane
make localnet-seed-demo
make localnet-status-control-plane
make localnet-run-token-adapter
make localnet-adapter-status
make validate-cpl
make policy-eval POLICY=examples/policies/central-bank-style-policy.json INVENTORY=examples/inventory/central-bank-eligible-inventory.json
make optimize POLICY=examples/policies/central-bank-style-policy.json INVENTORY=examples/inventory/central-bank-eligible-inventory.json OBLIGATION=examples/obligations/central-bank-window-call.json
make test-policy-engine
make test-optimizer
make daml-build
make daml-test
make demo-run
make demo-margin-call
make demo-margin-call-quickstart
make demo-return
make demo-return-quickstart
make demo-substitution
make demo-substitution-quickstart
make test-conformance
make demo-all
make docs-lint
make verify-portable
make verify
```

`CPL v0.1` schema coverage and the initial negative cases are documented in [CPL_VALIDATION_TEST_PLAN.md](./CPL_VALIDATION_TEST_PLAN.md). The policy-engine scenario coverage is documented in [POLICY_ENGINE_TEST_PLAN.md](./POLICY_ENGINE_TEST_PLAN.md). The optimizer scenario coverage is documented in [OPTIMIZER_TEST_PLAN.md](./OPTIMIZER_TEST_PLAN.md). The Daml workflow skeleton coverage is documented in [DAML_TEST_PLAN.md](./DAML_TEST_PLAN.md). The aggregate conformance suite is documented in [CONFORMANCE_SUITE.md](./CONFORMANCE_SUITE.md). The Quickstart LocalNet foundation now adds a pinned upstream checkout, compose-preflight smoke, isolated overlay start, seeded-scenario command surface, provider-visible Quickstart status evidence, Quickstart-backed margin-call, return, and substitution workflow handoff surfaces, and reference token adapter posting, return, plus substitution execution artifacts. The Python unit suites now share deterministic fixture builders, and the conformance layer now includes isolated helper tests in addition to the generated-suite assertions. The current repository now proves deterministic policy evaluation, deterministic collateral optimization, basic workflow lifecycle execution, end-to-end margin-call, return, and substitution demos with explicit negative paths, aggregate invariant pass/fail output, a standalone Quickstart reference token adapter proof path, the first real Quickstart-seeded collateral scenario, one real Quickstart-backed end-to-end margin-call chain, one real Quickstart-backed end-to-end return chain, one real Quickstart-backed end-to-end substitution chain, and a final demo package that centers those runtime-backed surfaces.

## Verification Tiers

- `make verify-portable` is the baseline repository gate for environments that can run the pinned Python and Daml toolchain but do not have Docker available.
- `make verify` is the full superset and adds `make localnet-smoke` so the pinned Quickstart compose surface remains an explicit environment-dependent gate.
- `make localnet-start-control-plane`, `make localnet-seed-demo`, `make localnet-status-control-plane`, `make localnet-run-token-adapter`, `make localnet-adapter-status`, `make demo-margin-call-quickstart`, `make demo-return-quickstart`, and `make demo-substitution-quickstart` are operator-facing Quickstart checks that currently sit outside the default verify targets because they require a running Docker stack, Quickstart auth wiring, and a seeded or reseeded LocalNet.

## Current Conformance Scope

The current conformance suite now covers:

- authorization and role control
- eligibility determinism
- haircut conservation and lendable-value correctness
- concentration-limit enforcement
- no double encumbrance
- atomic substitution and atomic settlement across legs
- return release-condition validation and retained-coverage safety
- replay safety
- report fidelity
- audit trail completeness
- negative paths for ineligible assets, expired calls, insufficient lendable value, concentration breaches, Quickstart workflow rejection without adapter movement, unauthorized release, replayed return instructions, stale obligation-state mismatches, attempted partial substitution under atomicity, and replayed instructions

## Traceability Expectations

- every new feature updates the invariant registry
- every invariant gains at least one planned or implemented verification hook
- every demo artifact must point back to the code path and command that generated it
- milestone planning should distinguish between specification-only evidence and executed conformance evidence
