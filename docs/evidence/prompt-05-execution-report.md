# Prompt 05 Execution Report

## Scope

Implement the first Daml domain model and workflow skeletons for confidential collateral control, including obligation, posting, substitution, return, settlement-intent, and execution-report boundaries plus executable Daml lifecycle checks.

## Commands

```sh
make bootstrap
make status
make validate-cpl
make daml-build
make daml-test
make demo-run
make verify
git status --short --branch
```

## Results

- `make bootstrap` passed and confirmed the pinned repo-local Daml SDK `2.10.4`, Temurin JDK `17.0.18+8`, and CPL validation tooling were ready.
- `make status` passed and reported the new phase name, the installed toolchain versions, and the expanded command surface including `make daml-test`.
- `make validate-cpl` passed and preserved the existing CPL schema and example-policy validation baseline.
- `make daml-build` passed and produced `.daml/dist/canton-collateral-policy-optimization-engine-0.1.0.dar` after the new `daml/CantonCollateral/` package was added.
- `make daml-test` passed and executed the Daml lifecycle scripts for margin call creation, posting and substitution, and return handling.
- `make demo-run` passed and executed `Bootstrap:workflowSmokeTest` against the Daml IDE ledger.
- `make verify` passed and now exercises docs linting, CPL validation, Daml build, Daml lifecycle tests, and the workflow smoke run in one reproducible loop.
- `git status --short --branch` showed the expected tracked and new files for the Daml package, ADR, domain mapping, test plan, and mission-control updates before commit.

Notes:

- the Daml helper emitted an informational notice that SDK `3.4.11` exists upstream; the repository remains intentionally pinned to `2.10.4`
- the current Daml package now carries real contract-level workflow skeletons, but policy evaluation, optimization, disclosure-profile refinement, and external settlement adapters remain future work
