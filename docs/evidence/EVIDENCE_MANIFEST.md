# Evidence Manifest

This manifest defines the evidence categories required to defend changes in this repository. Evidence should be concrete, reproducible, and linked to invariants where possible.

## Evidence Categories

| Category | Purpose | Typical Contents |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Specs | Capture intended behavior and interface expectations. | architecture notes, schema docs, workflow specs |
| ADRs | Record durable design decisions and rationale. | numbered ADRs and status changes |
| Code | Preserve the implemented logic that realizes documented behavior. | versioned source, configs, scripts, lockfiles |
| Tests | Show executable verification of behavior and invariants. | unit, integration, replay, property, and scenario tests |
| Demo artifacts | Show reproducible operator-facing demonstrations backed by real execution. | commands, transcripts, generated reports, screenshots when warranted |
| Economic rationale | Explain why policy, haircut, concentration, and optimization choices are defensible. | calibration notes, assumptions, references, model commentary |
| Security review | Show confidentiality, authorization, replay, and integrity concerns were reviewed. | threat model updates, review notes, findings, mitigations |
| Operational runbooks | Show how an operator can run, verify, and recover the system safely. | bootstrap, incident, demo, release, and rollback runbooks |

## Coverage Notes

- The `Code` category now includes the first Daml workflow skeleton package in addition to schema, bootstrap, and toolchain artifacts.
- The architecture, CPL, policy-engine, optimizer, Daml-boundary, and Quickstart-foundation packages now provide executable evidence, though adapter integration and workflow-coupled reference-data evidence are still pending.
- The `Demo artifacts` category now includes a pinned Quickstart compose-preflight execution record in addition to the workflow smoke record and generated policy and optimization artifacts, but still not a Quickstart-backed end-to-end operator demo.
- The evidence set now records the rename to "Canton Collateral Control Plane" as a semantic clarification of the same subsystem stack rather than a new product direction.
- Economic rationale is now architecture-, control-, and optimization-objective-oriented rather than calibration-backed.
